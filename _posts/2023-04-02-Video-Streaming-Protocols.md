Audio concepts:
Audio or sound is a natural pheniomenon. The sound travels through a medium as the particles in the medium vibrates and vibration of one partcile causes the next particle also to vibrate, and thus creating a wave though the medium. Like any kind of wave, sound wave also can be thought of a function of two parameters: the amplitude i.e. how futher the particles vibrate and the frequency i.e how many times they vibrate on a unit time. Computers however being digital in nature, need to convert this natural pehnomenon in analog signal to digital signal using A/D converter.
