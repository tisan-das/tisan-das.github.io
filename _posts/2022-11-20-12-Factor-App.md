## What is 12-Factor-App?

12-Factor App provides an overview on how a modern distributed system is supposed to work. It provides guidelines to standardize the process to ensure the distrbuted nature of the application. 


### The 12 Factors:
1. **Codebase**
- Codebase is always tracked through version control system
- 1:1 mapping between repository and system
	- If multiple repo involved, then it supposed to be a distrbuted system
- There can be multiple deployment stages, but only one repo

2. **Dependency**
- Never assume any implicit dependency, always declare the dependencies independently 
- Helps in containerizing the app

3. **Config**
- Have all the arributes that can vary based on deployments in a config file
	- Such attributes includes resource and credentials
- Litmus Test: Even if source code gets leaked, none of the credential gets compromised

4. **Backing services((
- Backing service: Any service that the app consumers as part of operational activities
- Treat backing services as attached resource
- Resources can be swapped without making any explicit changes in the codebase
- Info related to attached resources are supposed to be on config files

5. **Build, release, run**
- Have strict seperation between the build, release & run stages
	- Build: Convert repo to executable binaries 
    - Release: Take the build and deploy using the configuration
    - Run: Launches the app, and ready for executions
 
6. **Process**
- Execute the app as one or more stateless processes and should share-nothing
- Any data that needs to be stored, must be retained in persisntant storage as part of backing service
- Stateless process also denotes removal of sticky sessions from load-balencesrs

7. **Port binding**
- App is completely self-contained, doesn't rely on runtime injection of system to create a web-server
- User facing services are created entirely on the user-space, within the app's code

8. **Concurrency**
- Scale out via the process model
- The share-nothing, horizontally partitionable nature of twelve-factor app processes means that adding more concurrency is a simple and reliable operation

9. **Disposability**
- Processes are disposable: they can be started or stopped with moment's notice.
- Robustness against sudden failure: even for hardware, queing system might be helpful here

10. **Dev/prod parity**
- Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
- Resist the urge to use different backing services between development and production

11. **Logs**
- Treat logs as event streams
- Never concerns itself with routing or storage of its output stream
- The event stream for an app can be routed to a file, or watched via realtime tail in a terminal. Most significantly, the stream can be sent to a log indexing and analysis system, or a general-purpose data warehousing system

12. **Admin processes**
- Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
