title: Stock Market - Capital Returns
published: false

- Asset growth is a stronger determinant of returns than traditional value, size, and momentum. Companies often accelerate investment after their stocks have done relatively well and a majority of them later underperform. This suggests that asset growth may explain this. When analyzing the prospects of both value and growth stocks, it is necessary to take into account asset growth, both at the company and sectoral level.

- **Focus on supply rather than demand.** Supply prospects are far less uncertain than demand, and thus easier to forecast. Increases in an industry's aggregate supply are often well-flagged and come with varying lags - depending on the industry in question - after changes in the industry's aggregate capital spending.

- The turn in capital cycle often occurs **during periods of maximum pessimism**, as the weakest competitor throws in the towel at a point of extreme stress. Capex-to-depreciation is a good ratio to look for.

- The airlines have revolutionalized travel for over the last 60 years, with attendant economic benefits but again a poor supply side gas led to a very bumpy ride for investors.

- The starting point for company analysis is not the outlook for end demand, but rather the supply side. Our goal is to find investments in depressed industries at positive inflection points in the capital cycle and in the sectors with benign and stable supply-side fundamentals.

- **Look to invest in companies from sectors where capital was being withdrawn and avoid companies in industries where assets were increasing rapidly.**

- Lookout for factors:
        i. The emergence of oligopolies in industries hitherto characterized by low returns and excessive competition
        ii. The evolution of business models with high and rising barriers to entry
        iii. Management behavior that encourages these trends

- There's a certain set of companies that rely on an intermediary to sell their products (a doctor, plumber, locksmith, etc.) whose advice is relied upon by uninformed consumers who do not perceive the common interest of the producer and agent to sell high-margin products.

- Companies that provide indispensable services to their customers often prove to be excellent investments. Small companies don't want to be bothered with detailed, time-consuming work which carries a high risk of error for the inexperienced administrator.

- It is greatly dispiriting to see companies repeatedly buying back their shares as the cycle peaks, only to raise fresh capital at the trough.

- **Incentive of management:** The earning per share measure is prone to manipulation by unscrupulous executives; it takes no account of risk and encourages value-destroying acquisitions and buybacks, especially when the interest rates are low. Corporate strategy should be about how best to allocate resources.

- Insider ownership has always seemed as the most direct way to deal with the principal-agent problem, which arises with the separation of corporate management from ownership. Executives are required to build up significant shareholdings. Generous deferred share awards are one such way to encourage this. Families which are united and committed to handing down wealth to later generations have often proven themselves to be good stewards of capital.

- **Real strategy**, whether military or commercial, involves an assessment of the position one finds oneself in, the threats one faces, how one plan to overcome them, and how opponents might in turn respond. Prepare a few simple slides of: what does your global competitive environment look like? In the last three years, what have you done to alter the competitive landscape? In the same period, what have you done to them? How might they attack you in the future? What are your plans to leapfrog from them?

- When a **management team compliments a competitor**, this can be like gold dust to investors.

- **The intellectual honesty of executives can be tested by asking them to pick out what he or she thinks is important. We would like to ask what is not working and wait to see whether they've given the matter much thought.**

- Unashamedly, the company pronounces that the cost of borrowing from Anglo-Irish is higher than from a normal bank with whom a customer does his or her everyday banking business.

- Conventional wisdom that M&A destroys value over the long term, which is why the share price of an acquiring company normally falls when a deal is announced.

-**Inversion of the earlier bubble signs:**
    1. Commodity price decline
    2. Private equity valuation collapse
    3. Private equity losses
    4. Sunken floatations
    5. M&A doldrums
    6. Directors' dealings
    7. Retail investors burnt

- Beware of mechanisms that didn't spring up to take advantage of the system, but rather born of it. This often becomes a value trap.

- Roping in well-known figures confers just the right aura of respectability and allows us to roll out all sorts of "innovative" financial products in the new shadowy banking era. Remember the name of the product needs to be changed only once in a decade.

- **Follow the money principle**
