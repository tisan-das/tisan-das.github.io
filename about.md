Hey! I'm Tisan Das, a software engineer, on a journey to design a large-scale distributed system. As a software engineer, I've worked on multiple products with varying programming stacks involved. On the coding side, starting from a small component to generate queries, to a high-performance component to handle data streams, and to using cloud services.

On the professional front, I'm currently focusing on understanding the large-scale distributed system. Till now have explored a couple of concepts, and tried to create small POC on different aspects. However now I've started realizing the necessity of noting down. So this blog is my small attempt to note down all the concepts I'm going to study, pen down my understanding, and hone this skill.

I welcome you all to have a glimpse of my journey. And in case you find something interesting or willing to discuss something, I'm always happy to help.
